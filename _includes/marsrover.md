## Mars Rover

#### The Team
The [Mars Rover Design Team at Missouri S&T][1] was started in 2012 with the goal of competing in the [University Rover Challenge (URC)][2] held by the Mars Society in the desert of southern Utah.  Per their website, the Mars Society intends for the competition to challenge each team to "design and build the next generation of Mars rovers that will one day work alongside human explorers in the field."  The team at Missouri S&T is currently the best in the country and second best in the world as of 2014.

#### My Role

I joined in April 2013 and I was immediately put in charge of making an application that could be used to remotely control the rover and display telemetry data.  At the time, the team was new, behind schedule, and there was no software of any kind that could communicate with the rover, so I had to build it from the ground with no prior experience.  I chose to use WPF since I was already familiar with C# from previous internships.  This application has come to be named [Rover Engagement Display (RED)][3].

Today, myself and other team leads have managed to centralize all software development for the team on [Github][4].  Most of our work is either Open Source or will be after competition, and that includes RED.  My role on the team has evolved into leading a team of people responsible for maintaining and improving RED.  Most of the new members to the team are unfamiliar with WPF so lately I've been putting work into a training program called [Launch Pad][5].  Launch Pad assumes they have prior experience with programming but it serves as a way to give new members experience with Visual Studio, Git/Github, WPF, and the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern by walking them through a simple software development cycle.
