#### About Me

I am a computer scientist at the Missouri University of Science & Technology where I am PhD student.  I am funded by a GAANN fellowship provided by the US Department of Education.  My research covers the application of prediction algorithms to modular course structures in order to improve learning outcomes in education.  I've had many internships since starting college in 2009 working for a law firm (IT), an electric cooperative (software development), and a multinational steel manufacturer (software development).

On occasion, I create free websites for good causes such a [charity soccer tournament][2], [my fraternity][3], my research groups ([SeNDeComp][4], [IA-GAANN][5]), and professors I like ([Price][6]).  As a fan of science fiction, I couldn't help getting involved in the [Mars Rover Design Team][7] (I made their website too) at Missouri S&T when it was created in 2012.  I have also been known to [play and produce music][1] with one of childhood best friends.

If you can't tell, I intend to paint the web with Bootstrap, and I advocate the use of free services provided by Google to help people be more productive in their endeavors.  I'm familiar with many different technologies (see my resume) and I am a user of Git & Github.  My language of choice is highly dependent on what I'm doing.
