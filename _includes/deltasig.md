## Delta Sig

#### Background
After being initially opposed to the concept of social fraternities given their reputation, I came across such an organization at Missouri S&T that did not fit the stereotype - Delta Sigma Phi.  Many of the friends I made my first year of college surprised me by joining this particular fraternity and encouraged me to get to know more of the members which I did.  In Fall 2010 (start of my Sophomore year of college), I decided to join and have not regretted the experience.  Surrounding myself with high character and motivated individuals in college was one of the best decisions I made during my undergraduate years. The Missouri S&T chapter of Delta Sigma Phi I joined was colonized in 2006, and the lack of long-running tradition contributed greatly to what makes it different from the majority of fraternities.  My chapter has been recognized by Missouri S&T many times for its exemplary leadership and contributions to the community.  It has also been recognized nationally for the past 5 years as being one of the top 5 Delta Sigma Phi chapters out of over 120.

#### Recruitment
One of my biggest contributions to the fraternity was through recruitment.  In 2013, I was the first person to serve a full year as Director of Recruitment, and with the help of others, I implemented a recruitment plan that emphasized the importance of building genuine relationships with people on campus as the sole method of bringing in new members.  The idea is that only by building these relationships are we able to identify the highest quality individuals for membership.  A lot of these ideas come from *The Summit*, an annual training program I attended in 2013 put on by Delta Sigma Phi for those members in charge of recruitment for their chapter.  At the time, *The Summit* featured representatives from a company called *Phired Up* who specializes in training organizations for dynamic recruitment.  I'm also proud to have consulted pro bono for [ChapterBuilder][1], the web-based tool created by *Phired Up* and *TechniPhi* to implement dynamic recruitment, the recruitment practices they advocate.

#### Sphinx
For my senior design project, I created a fraternity management website which is currently in use by the Delta Epsilon chapter of Delta Sigma Phi.  I am actively maintaining and developing the project as an alumnus of the chapter.  You can read more about it [here][2].
