#### About Me

I am currently a PhD student in the Computer Science program at the Missouri University of Science & Technology.  I am also currently funded by a GAANN Fellowship provided by the US Department of Education.  My research covers the application of prediction algorithms to modular course structures in order to improve learning outcomes in education.  I've had many internships since starting college in 2009 working for a law firm (IT), an electric cooperative (software development), and a multinational steel manufacturer (software development).  I'm familiar with many different technologies (see resume) and I favor those that are best suited to accomplish the task at hand.

On occasion, I create free websites (using Bootstrap and Jekyll a lot) for good causes such a [charity soccer tournament][2], [my fraternity][3], my research groups ([SeNDeComp][4], [IA-GAANN][5]), and professors I like ([Price][6]).  As a fan of science fiction, I couldn't help getting involved in the [Mars Rover Design Team][7] (whose website I also created) at Missouri S&T after it was created in 2012.  I have also been known to [play and produce music][1] with one of childhood best friends.
