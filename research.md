## Research

I am PhD student under [Professor Ali Hurson][1] and [Professor Sahra Sedigh][2] ([SeNDeComp][3]) at Missouri S&amp;T where I am being funded by a [GAANN Fellowship][4] provided by the US Department of Education.  I am in my first semester of courses preparing for my qualifying exam in January 2015.

I am also researching the application of prediction algorithms to modular course structures in order to improve learning outcomes in education.  This work is a continuation of prior research on [ontology-based recommendation algorithms][5] and [proactive search techniques][6].
