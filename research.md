## Research

I am in my second semester as a PhD student under [Professor Ali Hurson][1] and [Professor Sahra Sedigh][2] ([SeNDeComp][3]) at Missouri S&amp;T.  I am being funded by a [GAANN Fellowship][4] from the US Department of Education.

I am researching the application of prediction algorithms to modular course structures in order to improve learning outcomes in education.  This work is a continuation of prior research on [ontology-based recommendation algorithms][5] and [proactive search techniques][6].
