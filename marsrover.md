## Mars Rover

#### The Team
The [Mars Rover Design Team at Missouri S&amp;T (MRDT)][1] was started in 2012 with the goal of competing in the [University Rover Challenge (URC)][2] held by the Mars Society in the desert of southern Utah.  Per their website, the Mars Society intends for the competition to challenge each team to "design and build the next generation of Mars rovers that will one day work alongside human explorers in the field."  The team at Missouri S&amp;T is currently the best in the country and second best in the world as of 2014.

#### My Role

I joined in April 2013 and I was immediately put in charge of making an application that could be used to remotely control the rover and display telemetry data.  At the time, the team was new, behind schedule, and there was no software of any kind that could communicate with the rover.  I had to build it from the ground up with my only prior experience being C#.  I chose to use WPF since I was already familiar with C# from previous internships.  This application has morphed into [Rover Engagement Display (RED)][3].

Today, myself and other MRDT leads have managed to centralize all software development on [Github][4].  Most of our work is either Open Source or will be after competition, and that includes RED.  My role on the team has evolved into leading the team of people responsible for maintaining and improving RED.  Since the team is new, I've also found myself playing a role in laying the groundwork for the software development practices of the team.  This includes teaching Git and new member education.

Nearly all of the new members that join my team are unfamiliar with WPF (due to their age and the curriculum at S&amp;T) so in Fall 2014 I created a training program called [Launch Pad][5].  Launch Pad assumes they have prior experience with programming but it serves as a way to give new members experience with Visual Studio, Git/Github, WPF, and the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) design pattern by walking them through a simple software development cycle.
