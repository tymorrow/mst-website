#### Research
My adivsors are [Professor Ali Hurson][1] and [Professor Sahra Sedigh][2] ([SeNDeComp][3]).  I am currently funded by a GAANN Fellowship from the US Department of Education.

I am researching the application of prediction algorithms to sequences, such as modular course structures, in order to improve learning outcomes in education.  This work is a continuation of prior research on [ontology-based recommendation algorithms][5] and [proactive search techniques][6].
