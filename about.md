## About Me

---

As an undergraduate at Missouri S&T, I joined [Delta Sigma Phi][3] fraternity and the [Mars Rover Design Team][4] while also working for the Computer Science and Residential Life departments.
I completed my Computer Science B.S. in 2014 at [Missouri S&T][1].

I am now an MS student in Computer Science in the same place.
[My research][2] is currently focused on the development and application of prediction algorithms to sequences.  

Since 2009 I've worked for a law firm (IT), an electric cooperative (software development), and a multinational steel manufacturer (software development).  You can download my CV [here][5].
