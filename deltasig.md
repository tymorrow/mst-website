## Delta Sig

#### Background
After being initially opposed to the concept of social fraternities given their reputation, I came across an organization at Missouri S&amp;T that did not fit the stereotype - Delta Sigma Phi.  Many of the friends I made my first year of college surprised me by joining this particular fraternity and encouraged me to get to know more of the members, which I did.  In Fall 2010 (start of my Sophomore year of college), I decided to join, and I did not regret doing so.  Surrounding myself with high-character and motivated individuals in college was one of the best decisions I made during my undergraduate years. 

Delta Sig at Missouri S&amp;T was re-colonized in 2006 after over a decade-long absense.  The lack of long-running traditions and the character of those who started things again in 2006 contibute greatly to what *still* makes it different from the majority of fraternities.  Delta Sig at Missouri S&amp;T has been recognized many times by the school and community for its exemplary leadership and contributions to the community.  It has also been recognized nationally for the past 5 years as being one of the top five Delta Sigma Phi chapters out of around 100.

#### Recruitment
One of my biggest contributions to the fraternity was through recruitment.  In 2013, I was the first person to serve a full year as Director of Recruitment.  With the help of others, I implemented a recruitment plan that emphasized the importance of building genuine relationships with people on campus as the sole method of bringing in new members.  The idea is simple: only by building these relationships are we able to identify the highest quality individuals for membership.  A lot of these ideas come from *The Summit*, an annual training program I attended in 2013 put on by Delta Sigma Phi for those members in charge of recruitment for their chapter.  At the time, *The Summit* featured representatives from a company called *Phired Up* who specialize in training organizations for dynamic recruitment.  I'm also proud to have consulted pro bono for [ChapterBuilder][1], the web-based tool created by *Phired Up* and *TechniPhi* to supplement dynamic recruitment, the recruitment practices they advocate.

#### Sphinx
For my senior design project, I created a fraternity management website which is currently in use by the Delta Epsilon chapter of Delta Sigma Phi.  I am actively maintaining and developing the project as an alumnus of the chapter.  You can read more about it [here][2].
